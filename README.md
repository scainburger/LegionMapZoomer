The above screenshot shows the default options. Dropdown options can be configured to be "Default" (i.e. unchanged behaviour), "Dalaran", or "Broken Isles".

Order Halls also have the option "Custom". This enables a dropdown box with the above options for each order hall, so they can be customised individually. 

Dungeons and Raids also have the option "Dungeon Zone" or "Raid Zone", which is simply the area of the Broken Isles in which the instance is located i.e. for Emerald Nightmare, the Raid Zone would be Val'sharah.
