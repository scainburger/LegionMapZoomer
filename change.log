2.0: 
	- Removed ability to customise zoom-out from raids and dungeons
		- It was a lot of work to implement and maintain for a mostly useless feature
		- To update for BfA was getting messy; seeing as it was mostly unused anyway and is now old content, I scrapped it.
		- ORDER HALLS ARE STILL SUPPORTED! :)
	- Code updates to work with API changes, code cleanup, updated Ace3 library

	- This will likely be the final update. If things break in the future I'll probably not fix them.
	- That said, thanks for using my addon! It's old content now, so I won't be offended if you delete it :)

1.2:
	- Updated to work with ToS, Antorus and Seat of the Triumvirate

1.1.2:
	- Improved accuracy of DH and DK order hall detection

1.1.1:
	- Fix imports file extensions

1.1:
